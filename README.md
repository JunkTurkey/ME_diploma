# Matrix deformation with Zernike polynomials
Was developed to solving matrix deformation problems which happens with Talysurf profilometer (Taylor Hobson ltd) measurements.
This program represents MatLab m-file which change SOURCE matrix with Zernike polynomials. The only move you need to use program is to change coefficient you want at 156 line.
